# Zotero to iCloud Plugin
**Not intended for public usage**

Zotero plugin that copies and links new papers to iCloud. This allows usage of Zotero **without** Zotero Cloud and Zotero Reader.

Currently, Zotero saves all PDFs in a specified folder that cannot be placed inside an iCloud folder. Synchronization of files happens over the Zotero Cloud, which is limited in space, and with the Zotero Apps, which are restricted to the internal PDF reader. 
This plugin automatically copies and links new files to a specified iCloud folder and has the option to update file tags in iCloud according to the tags in Zotero.

Not intended for public usage.
